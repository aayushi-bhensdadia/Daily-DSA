This folder contains problems and concepts that are **not frequently asked in coding rounds** but are valuable for:  
- Expanding theoretical knowledge  
- Building stronger fundamentals  
- Preparing for in-depth discussions in interviews  
- Understanding rare but elegant algorithms/techniques

## Notes
- These problems are **not essential** for online assessments or initial coding rounds.  
- They are mainly useful in:  
  - **Advanced interviews** (FAANG/Research/Competitive Programming)  
  - **Discussions with interviewers** when they probe deeper  
  - **Competitive programming contests**  
- Think of this folder as **"extra knowledge"** rather than must-do DSA.
